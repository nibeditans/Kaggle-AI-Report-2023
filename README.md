# Kaggle-AI-Report-2023
The "Kaggle AI Report 2023" repository houses my notebook from a recent Kaggle competition that I participated in.
This competition provided an exciting opportunity to apply data science and artificial intelligence techniques to tackle a specific problem. In this repository, you will find my comprehensive report, detailing the approach, methodologies, and insights gained from analyzing the competition's dataset. The notebook showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. By sharing this repository, I aim to contribute to the data science community, inspire fellow enthusiasts, and foster collaboration.




## Competition Overview

The competition revolved around building a predictive model to identify fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset. Participants were provided with a dataset containing transaction records, each associated with various features such as transaction amount, merchant information, and customer attributes. The goal of the competition was to develop a model that accurately detects fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Approach

In this notebook, I followed a systematic approach to solve the problem. The key steps included:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing: I conducted a thorough analysis of the provided dataset, exploring the distributions and relationships between features. I also handled missing values and outliers, and performed necessary data transformations.
2. Feature engineering: I engineered additional features from the existing ones, utilizing domain knowledge and creative techniques to capture relevant patterns and information.
3. Model development: I trained and evaluated several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. I fine-tuned the models using appropriate hyperparameter optimization techniques.
4. Model evaluation: I assessed the performance of the models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also analyzed the confusion matrix and calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to understand the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
5. Results and insights: Based on the evaluation results, I identified the best-performing model and deployed it for predicting fraudulent transactions. I discussed the model's strengths and limitations and provided insights into the factors contributing to fraudulent activities.
